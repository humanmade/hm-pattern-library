<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>We are always looking to improve the Juniper project. New components will be added and we are keen to improve the codebase over time. We will not be committed to backwards compatability between major releases.</p>
<p>If you build something with Juniper, and create a component that may be useful to others, we'd love to include it! <a href="https://github.com/humanmade/hm-pattern-library/issues/new">Open an issue on Github</a></p>
